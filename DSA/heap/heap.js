// What is a complete binary tree?
// A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels except the last level,
//  i.e., leaf node should be completely filled, and all the nodes should be left-justified.

// min heap : the value of the parent node is less than the children
// max heap : the value of the parent node is higher than the children

// heap is internally an aray and represented as a tree.

// insertion O(logn) min and max item at o(1)
